  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This gingersnap cookie recipe makes gingersnap cookies that melt in your mouth. I received this ginger cookie
    recipe from my grandmother; it's been enjoyed in my family since 1899. Store cookies in an airtight container.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>⅓ cup cinnamon sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¾ cup shortening</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>¼ cup dark molasses</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place cinnamon sugar in a bowl; set aside.</li>
    <li>Sift flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir the mixture until blended, then
      sift a second time into another bowl.</li>
    <li>Beat shortening in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Gradually beat in white sugar. Add egg and
      molasses and beat until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Sift 1/3 of the flour mixture into the shortening mixture; stir to thoroughly blend. Sift in the remaining flour
      mixture and mix together until a soft dough forms.</li>
    <li>Pinch off small amounts of dough and roll them with your hands into 1-inch-diameter balls. Place balls in
      cinnamon sugar and roll to coat, then place 2-inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are rounded and slightly cracked, about 10 minutes, switching racks
      halfway through. Cool cookies on a wire rack.</li>
  </ol>
